# Antigravity Rules

1. **Scripts and Testing**: Always create temporary or test scripts in the `/scripts/` folder. This folder is excluded from the Git repository. Never create scripts in the root directory or other tracked folders unless explicitly requested.
2. **Commit Hygiene**: When pushing changes to Git, ensure that no temporary files, logs, or diagnostic scripts are included in the commit.
